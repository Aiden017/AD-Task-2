            <h2>Nero</h2>
            <p>
                Nero is one of the main protagonists of the <em>Devil May Cry</em> franchise. He first appeared as a playable character in <em>Devil May Cry 4</em>, and later in <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>. He was raised in Fortuna and served as a Holy Knight in the Order of the Sword, a religious group that worships Sparda and fights to protect the world from demons. It is later revealed that he is the son of Vergil, nephew of Legendary Devil Hunter Dante, and grandson of Legendary Dark Knight Sparda.
                <br><br>
                In <em>Devil May Cry 4</em>, he is forced to fight the Order after encountering Dante and discovering a conspiracy by his own kind to conquer the world using The Savior. In <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, Nero is a more seasoned demon hunter who has since started a mobile Devil May Cry branch. He fends off a demonic invasion as he hunts the mysterious Urizen, who stole his demonic right arm.
