            <h2>Vergil</h2>
            <p>
                Vergil is the older twin brother of Dante and one of the main antagonists of the <em>Devil May Cry</em> franchise. Following the death of their mother as children, Vergil and Dante went their separate ways, with Vergil rejecting his humanity and embracing his demonic heritage, in contrast with his younger brother's embrace of humanity and initial rejection of the demonic. Stoic and reserved, Vergil displays a willingness to do anything in his quest to obtain the power of his father, Sparda.
                <br><br>
                Suffering defeat in confrontation with Mundus in the secret ending to <em>Devil May Cry 3</em>, he is tortured and transformed into the Black Knight – being encountered in <em>Devil May Cry</em> under the name Nelo Angelo. After numerous conflicts throughout the game, he is finally defeated by Dante.
                <br><br>
                In <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, years after his last encounter with Dante as Nelo Angelo, Vergil is now free from Mundus' control, but has become very weakened as a result. As the hooded figure who took back Yamato while ripping the Devil Bringer from his son Nero in the process, Vergil is the true main antagonist of the game after both the newcomer V and Urizen merge back together as himself, with both revealed to be his human and demonic halves.
