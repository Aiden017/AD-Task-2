                V is one of the main protagonists and the third playable character introduced in Devil May Cry 5. A human with demonic ties, V presents himself as Dante's new client to put him on the trail of Urizen and takes Nero as backup insurance. It's revealed later that V is, in fact, the human half of Vergil.
